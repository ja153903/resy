## About

This is a simple project I want to create as POC for a work project we're going to undertake. I want to see if I can create a simple Restaurant reservation client with the following technologies:

- Next.js
- Prisma
- Zustand
- TanStack Query
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- PlanetScale

I don't want to include tRPC in this project just yet because it doesn't support TanStack Query v4.

## File Structure

The repository's file structure comes from Bulletproof React where we split logic pieces into features.
